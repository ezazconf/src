# Overview
azure-cli is an Azure command-line interface

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via command injection, when an application processes user input that includes & or | characters.

## NOTE:
This vulnerability is only exploitable on Windows systems by applications using Powershell (and not cmd) to execute CLI commands.
