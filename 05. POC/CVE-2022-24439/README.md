# Overview
GitPython is a python library used to interact with Git repositories

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) due to improper user input validation, which makes it possible to inject a maliciously crafted remote URL into the clone command. Exploiting this vulnerability is possible because the library makes external calls to git without sufficient sanitization of input arguments. This is only relevant when enabling the ext transport protocol.
