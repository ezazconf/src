# CVE-2020-1747

## Description
There is untrusted YAML Deserialization vulnerability on PyTorchLightning Github repository. PyTorchLightning's saving.py (core.saving.load_hparams_from_yaml) functionality is calling "yaml.UnsafeLoader" from pyyaml Python library which is not secure method. Because of that, maliciously crafted yaml config file can cause code execution on the victim's machine.

After that, you need to start HTTP server on your attacker machine's port 8080. When you run the below command, you will see the HTTP request from the victim host because of the malicious yaml file.
```
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Run the poc.py file after that you will see HTTP request from coming the victim host,
```
python3 poc.py
```

## Impact
Maliciously crafted yaml config file can cause code execution on the victim's machine.
